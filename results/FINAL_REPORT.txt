FINAL RESEARCH REPORT
Migration and Labor Market Dynamics in Germany (2000-2024)
================================================================================

Analysis Date: 2026-01-14 00:24:56
Dataset: 16 German states, 2000-2024
Total Observations: 400
Test Period: 2020-2024

================================================================================
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
================================================================================

1. Do job vacancies predict foreign migration patterns?
2. Does labor market tightness predict foreign migration patterns?
3. Can labor market indicators improve migration forecasts?

================================================================================
METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Data Analysis Approach:
   • Correlation analysis (Pearson) for H1 and H2
   • Global forecasting models trained on 16 states simultaneously
   • Baseline models: Naive, AutoARIMA (no covariates)
   • Global models: LinearReg, RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM (with covariates)
   • SHAP explainability for feature importance
   • Statistical significance testing (α = 0.05)

Key Variables:
   Target: migration_foreign (foreign migration balance)
   Covariates:
     • unemployment_rate
     • vacancies_sc (job vacancies subject to social contributions)
     • labor_market_tightness (vacancies/unemployed)
     • unemployed_count
     • vacancy_rate

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED

This study provides strong, triangulated evidence that labor market
indicators significantly predict and improve forecasts of foreign migration
patterns across all 16 German states.

Three Lines of Evidence:
   1. Correlation Analysis: Both job vacancies (r=0.640) and
      labor market tightness (r=0.639) strongly correlate
      with migration (both p<0.001)

   2. Predictive Power: Models using labor market variables are
      25.3% more accurate than baseline models
      (p=0.000689)

   3. Feature Importance: SHAP analysis confirms labor market
      variables are among the top predictive features

================================================================================
LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

Study Limitations:
   • Limited to 25 years of data (2000-2024)
   • Yearly aggregation misses within-year dynamics
   • Omitted variables:
     - Housing costs and availability
     - Education quality and university rankings
     - Cultural amenities and quality of life
     - Social networks and diaspora effects
     - Immigration policy changes
   • Correlation does not prove causation
   • Model performance varies by state (heterogeneity)

================================================================================
FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
================================================================================

Recommended Extensions:
   1. Include additional covariates:
      • Housing market indicators
      • GDP growth and regional economic indicators
      • Education and amenity indices
      • Cultural diversity measures

   2. Test causality:
      • Granger causality tests
      • Instrumental variable analysis
      • Difference-in-differences (policy changes)

   3. Extend analysis:
      • Analyze specific nationality groups separately
      • Use monthly/quarterly data for higher resolution
      • Compare with other European countries
      • Investigate regional spillover effects
