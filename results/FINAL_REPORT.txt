METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Statistical Approach:
   • Correlation analysis (Pearson) for H1 and H2
   • Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α_adj = 0.003125)
   • One-sample t-tests for overall hypothesis testing
   • Paired t-test for model comparison (H3)
   • SHAP values for feature importance analysis
   • Significance level: α = 0.05

Modeling Approach:
   • Global forecasting models trained on 16 states simultaneously
   • Baseline models: Naive, AutoARIMA (no covariates)
   • Global models: LinearReg, RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM (with covariates)
   • Behavioral lag specification: lags_future_covariates=[-1, 0]
   • Training period: 2000-2019 (20 years)
   • Test period: 2020-2024 (5 years)

Key Variables:
   Target:
     • migration_foreign (foreign migration balance)
   Covariates:
     • unemployment_rate
     • vacancies_sc (job vacancies subject to social contributions)
     • labor_market_tightness (vacancies/unemployed)
     • unemployed_count
     • vacancy_quality_ratio (vacancies_sc/vacancies_total)

KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYPOTHESIS 1: Job Vacancies → Foreign Migration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRONGLY SUPPORTED

Correlation Evidence:
   • Mean correlation: r = 0.640
   • Range: [0.150, 0.755]

OVERALL CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

Hypothesis Support: 3/3 hypotheses strongly supported

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED

This study provides strong, triangulated evidence that labor market
indicators significantly predict and improve forecasts of foreign migration
patterns across all 16 German states.

Three Lines of Evidence:

1. CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
   • Job vacancies correlation: r = 0.640 (p < 0.001)
   • Labor tightness correlation: r = 0.639 (p < 0.001)
   • After Bonferroni correction:
     - H1: 15/16 states significant
     - H2: 15/16 states significant

2. PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE:
   • Mean improvement: 25.3%
   • Paired t-test: p = 0.0006887338
   • Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.979

3. FEATURE IMPORTANCE (SHAP):
   • Labor market variables: 84.2% of predictive power
   • Confirms importance alongside historical patterns

KEY INSIGHT:
   The robust evidence across multiple methodologies (correlation,
   prediction accuracy, explainability) and statistical rigor
   (Bonferroni correction) provides strong support for the role
   of labor market conditions in shaping migration patterns.

================================================================================
METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS
================================================================================

Multiple Comparison Correction:
   Bonferroni correction applied (α_adj = 0.003125) to control
   family-wise error rate when testing 16 states separately.

Triangulated Evidence:
   Three independent lines of evidence (correlation, prediction, SHAP)
   all support the same conclusion.

Effect Size Reporting:
   Cohen's d reported alongside p-values to assess practical significance.

Behavioral Lag Specification:
   Models include both contemporaneous and lagged labor market indicators,
   capturing decision-making delays in migration behavior.

Global Forecasting Approach:
   Models learn shared patterns across 16 states while allowing
   state-specific predictions.

================================================================================
LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

Data Limitations:
   • 25 years of data (2000-2024)
   • Annual aggregation misses within-year dynamics
   • Test period includes COVID-19 disruption (2020-2021)

Omitted Variables:
   • Housing costs and availability
   • Education quality and university rankings
   • Cultural amenities and quality of life
   • Social networks and diaspora effects
   • Immigration policy changes
   • Wage levels and income inequality

Methodological Considerations:
   • Correlation does not prove causation
   • Model performance varies by state (heterogeneity)
   • Global models assume shared parameters across states
   • Bonferroni correction is conservative (may miss true effects)

================================================================================
FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
================================================================================

1. Causal Inference:
   • Granger causality tests
   • Instrumental variable analysis
   • Difference-in-differences (policy changes)
   • Structural equation modeling

2. Extended Covariates:
   • Housing market indicators (rent, availability)
   • GDP growth and regional economic indicators
   • Education and amenity indices
   • Wage levels and income distribution
   • Cultural diversity and integration measures

3. Methodological Extensions:
   • Higher frequency data (monthly/quarterly)
   • Separate analysis by nationality groups
   • Spatial spillover effects between states
   • State-specific (local) models for comparison
   • Machine learning ensemble methods

4. Comparative Analysis:
   • Compare with other European countries
   • Analyze internal vs. international migration
   • Study emigration patterns (outflows)

================================================================================
POLICY IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

If labor market conditions strongly influence migration patterns,
then policymakers could:

1. Strategic Labor Market Planning:
   • Use vacancy forecasts to anticipate migration flows
   • Coordinate housing and infrastructure with job creation

2. Regional Development:
   • Target job creation in states seeking more migrants
   • Address labor shortages through economic development

3. Integration Planning:
   • Prepare integration services ~1 year before expected arrivals
   • Scale resources based on labor market indicators

4. Migration Forecasting:
   • Incorporate labor market indicators in official projections
   • Monitor vacancy trends as leading indicators
